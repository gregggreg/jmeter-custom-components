So far the only useful thing here is the GoogleCloudEndpointsLogParser.

This is a custom log parser for the GTMHTTPDebugLogs that Google Cloud
Endpoints outputs when you have logging enabled. It can be used 
to replay these logs to load test a Google Cloud Enpoints API in a 
similar fashion to how you would normally use the JMeter HTTP Log Parsers 
for web load testing.

Note, I have only used Google Cloud Endpoints for IOS so far, so I don't
know for sure if the logs are identical for the Android or Javascript clients
and so far I only have instructions for setting it up for IOS.

HOWTO SETUP ON IOS

1. In your app, add the following line wherever you are configuring 
Google Cloud Enpoints:

[GTMHTTPFetcher setLoggingEnabled:YES];

2. Run your app and note the line that pops up that looks like this:

GTMHTTPFetcher logging to "/Users/greg/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/7.1/Applications/169E8C7F-7B02-410B-8BCF-868BD9376A4F/GTMHTTPDebugLogs"

This is where your logs for this session will be stored.

3. Go through a sample session for your app that would be approriate
for replaying for load testing.

4. Fork/download this repo locally.

5. At the top level of the repo, install with maven:

mvn install

6. When this completes, you should have the resulting jar under /target called
jmeter-custom-components-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT.jar.

7. Download the latest JMeter from Apache (binary is fine) here:

http://jmeter.apache.org/

and un tar/zip it somewhere. These custom components were compiled against
JMeter 2.11, but I would think that most versions should work because I 
don't think the LogParser interface has changed much.

6. Copy the resulting jar from step 6 into the lib/ext directory under 
Jmeter.

7. Run JMeter like you normally would. When you set up an AccessLogSampler,
choose the GoogleCloudEndpointsLogParser parser instead of the default and 
for the Log File Location, point it to the root directory listed in step 2.

For more information on how to set up JMeter load testing for a web app,
check out these instructions:

https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_accesslog_sampler_step_by_step.pdf

It should be very simple to follow these steps, but select the 
GoogleCloudEndpointsLogParser instead. This log parser will automatically 
parse out the HTTP method, URL endpoint, headers and POST body and replay 
for each request. So you shouldn't have to set up any of your own 
HTTP Request Defaults or HTTP Managers.
